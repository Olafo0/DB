There are four files I want you to be editing. 

Employees Controller
Orders Controller
Product Controller
Stock Controller


I want you to write crud options for all 4 entities. 
Create
Read
Update
Delete

The syntax for the Controller methods (Endpoints) is as follows

public IActionResult GetById(int id){
  return Ok();
}
